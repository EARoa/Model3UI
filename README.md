Model 3 UI app for iPad
===================


Recreating the Model 3's dashboard in one simple iPad app. Idea comes from a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/6r3z8q/tesla_model_3_interactive_ui/), thanks for sharing the assets [/u/ichorus_sco](https://www.reddit.com/user/ichorus_sco) */s*

Feel free to use this app as you wish. Coming to Testflight (and maybe the AppStore) eventually
